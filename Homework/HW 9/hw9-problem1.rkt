; Problem 1
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; You are now ready to implement Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/),
; at least most of it ;)

; You've actually done quite a bit this semester already, and so the first step
; is to review some of the definitions you'll use to build your game.

; TODO 0/8: Read the following sections of (annotated) definitions - as needed,
;           go back to the sample solutions & walkthrough videos of the
;           associated assignments in order to make sure you understand each
;           piece of the program we have thus far!

; Data (General)
; --------------
;
; - Pair (NEW)
;   A generalized definition for associating two arbitrary
;   data types; this is used both for LetterStatusPair and
;   in helping to visualize elements of the game by
;   pairing up a game object, such as a guesed letter, with
;   a function used to visualize that type of object
;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(define-struct pair [first second])

; A [Pair X Y] is a (make-pair X Y)
; Interpretation: a pairing of two values

;
; Data (Letters)
; --------------

; - LetterStatus (Homework 2)
;   A categorization of scored letters
;
; - LetterStatusPair (Homework 3)
;   An association between a specific letter and its scored
;   status; updated to use Pair
;
; - VizPair (NEW)
;   An association between a value and a function that can
;   produce an image for it
;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; A LetterStatus (LS) is one of:
; - "wrong"
; - "misplaced"
; - "right"
; Interpretation: status of a guessed letter

; A LetterStatusPair (LSP) is a [Pair 1String LetterStatus]

; produces a vizualization of it

; TODO 2/8: Now, finish designing the function read-dictionary, which reads and

;           status in the supplied correct word.

;           Notes:

;           - You are highly encouraged to use mymap2 (see "Functions (General)"
;             section above), as well as string-in-list? (TODO #1).
;           - FYI: this approach is not 100% consistent with the NY Times, which
;             handles repeated letters in a somewhat more complicated fashion

; When a player is actively guessing, they may have fewer letters than are
; required of a full Wordle guess (5, in the NYT version).

; TODO 4/8: Finish designing the function partial-guess->full-guess, which pads
;           a string with spaces up to the supplied length.
;
;           Notes:
;           - You have been supplied a sufficient set of tests for this
;             function; they should all pass once your code is written.
;           - You have ALSO been supplied a working coded version of the
;             function that uses string-based helpers; to practice ISL list
;             abstractions, your code is REQUIRED to instead solve this task
;             using explode (to convert the string to a list of 1String's),
;             build-list (to produce extra spaces, as necessary), append (to
;             combine the guess with its padding), and then implode (to convert
;             the list of 1String's back into a string).
;           - Once these tests pass, uncomment the partial-guess->image design
;             below, which allows you to easily visualize a partial guess:
;             BOTH the current guess, as well as the remaining (blank) guesses.

;
;           Notes:
;           - Your play screen should (at least)...
;             * Visualize all prior guesses (a combination of score, lsp->image,
;               and row->image are useful here)
;             * Visualize the current partial guess (partial-guess->image is

;               tells you the number of letters per guess)
;             * Visualize any remaining future guesses (partial-guess->image can
;               also be quite useful here)
;           - As a suggestion: separate each piece of the interface into
