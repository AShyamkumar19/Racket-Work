; Problem 3
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Let's make a SUPER simple wordle-esque game... we'll call simple wordle.

; You start the game with a blank screen, waiting for a player to type a
; valid letter (A-E, upper- or lower-case should work; cough, see problem #1);
; pressing any other key should not have any effect.

; Once a valid letter has been pressed, display that (in upper-case form) and
; wait for a key to be pressed, which could be...
;
; - backspace ("\b" in DrRacket) to go to the prior step;
; - or enter ("\r" in DrRacket) to see if they win
;
; (again, pressing any other key should not have any effect).

; Once enter has been pressed, the game is over. The player wins if they entered
; "C", but lose otherwise. If they win, they see a smiley face (":)") and the game
; returns a certain number of points; if they lose, they get a sad face (":(") and
; lose those points.

; To begin, here is a data definition you'll use for this problem...


; A SimpleWordle is one of:
; - ""
; - "A"
; - "B"
; - "C"
; - "D"
; - "E"
; - ":)"
; - ":("
; Interpretation: status of a simple wordle game, where...
; - nothing has been entered yet ("");
; - a valid character has been entered ("A"-"E"); or
; - the entry has been scored right (":)") or wrong (":(")

(define SW-EMPTY "")
(define SW-A "A")
(define SW-B "B")
(define SW-C "C")
(define SW-D "D")
(define SW-E "E")
(define SW-CORRECT ":)")
(define SW-INCORRECT ":(")

(define (sw-temp sw)
  (...
   (cond
     [(string=? sw SW-EMPTY) ...]
     [(string=? sw SW-A) ...]
     [(string=? sw SW-B) ...]
     [(string=? sw SW-C) ...]
     [(string=? sw SW-D) ...]
     [(string=? sw SW-E) ...]
     [(string=? sw SW-CORRECT) ...]
     [(string=? sw SW-INCORRECT) ...])))


; And here's an example function that uses this data definition (that might
; come in handy later!)


; simple-wordle/eval : SW -> SW
; the correct answer is only C in simple wordle

(check-expect (simple-wordle/eval SW-EMPTY) SW-INCORRECT)
(check-expect (simple-wordle/eval SW-A) SW-INCORRECT)
(check-expect (simple-wordle/eval SW-B) SW-INCORRECT)
(check-expect (simple-wordle/eval SW-C) SW-CORRECT)
(check-expect (simple-wordle/eval SW-D) SW-INCORRECT)
(check-expect (simple-wordle/eval SW-E) SW-INCORRECT)
(check-expect (simple-wordle/eval SW-CORRECT) SW-INCORRECT)
(check-expect (simple-wordle/eval SW-INCORRECT) SW-INCORRECT)

(define (simple-wordle/eval sw)
  (if (string=? sw SW-C)
      SW-CORRECT
      SW-INCORRECT))


; Now building on this work, make sure to read the following four steps
; before starting :)

; TODO 1/4: Design the function simple-wordle-done?, which accepts a SimpleWordle
;           and returns #true only if it is SW-CORRECT or SW-INCORRECT.
;
;           Hint: start with the template and then see if you can simplify!



; TODO 2/4: Design the function draw-simple-wordle, which accepts a SimpleWordle
;           and produces a visualization of it. Empty should just be a blank
;           image; A-E should just have the letter in the middle; and the
;           (in)correct should show the appropriate face.
;
;           Hint: after making your tests, see if you can detect a pattern to
;           produce a simple visualization function.



; TODO 3/4: Uncomment the following function - you are not allowed to change it, but
;           rather you must design the two helper functions it references.
;           The first (key-simple-wordle/empty) produces a SimpleWordle based upon
;           the key pressed when the player is facing an empty screen.
;           The second (key-simple-wordle/letter) produces a SimpleWord based upon
;           the key pressed when the player has already entered a valid guess.
;
;           Hint: start by understanding the supplied tests, then, for each helper,
;           work through the steps of the design recipe one at a time.

; TODO 4/4: Write the code for the function play-simple-wordle, which uses big-bang
;           to play a game of SimpleWordle. When calling the function, the player
;           provides the points to return if they win (or negative that value if
;           they lose the game). You have been provided the signature and purpose,
;           as well as a commented-out test; you just need to write the function
;           code in the middle.
;
;           Hint: you have all the handlers you need, so your decisions to make...
;           - what is the initial state (i.e., how does your game begin?)
;           - what events matter in this game, and what handlers do you have for them?
;           - what will big-bang return, and how do you combine that with the points
;             you've been supplied?
