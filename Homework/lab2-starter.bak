;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; TODO 1/1: Design the function string-starts-with?, which takes two
;           Strings and determines if the first begins with the second.
;           This could happen in three situations...
;           - The second string is empty ("")
;           - The strings are actually the same
;           - The first string is longer than the second,
;             and the beginning of the first string is the same as
;             the second

;           Provide a signature, uncomment the supplied tests, and
;           write the code for the function that matches the description.

; Problem 2
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;


; You are to design a small door-simulator program...
;
; - A door can either be open, closed, or locked. Your program
;   will take in a representation of one of these states as its
;   starting position.
;
; - The user can open a closed door by pressing the "o"
;   key on their keyboard. You cannot open a locked door,
;   and attempting to open an already open door will do nothing.
;
; - The user can close an open door by pressing the "c" key
;   on their keyboard. Attempting to close an already closed
;   (or closed and locked) door will do nothing.
;
; - The user can lock a closed door by pressing the "l" key
;   on their keyboard. Attempting to lock an open door or an
;   already locked door will do nothing.
;
; - The user can unlock a locked door by pressing the "u" key
;   on their keyboard. Attempting to unlock a closed door that
;   is already unlocked, or an open door, will do nothing.

; When finished, you'll uncomment the following code and run
; something like ... (door-simulator "open")


; door-simulator : DoorState -> DoorState
; Simulates a lockable door

#|
(define (door-simulator ds)
  (big-bang ds
    [to-draw draw-door]
    [on-key change-door]))
|#


; TODO 1/3: Finish the Design Recipe for data for DoorState
;           (so provide examples and a template).


; A DoorState is one of:
; - "closed"
; - "locked"
; - "open"
; Interpretation: state of a lockable door



; TODO 2/3: Design the function draw-door takes a DoorState and
;           produces a corresponding image. To help get you
;           started, you have been provided...
;           - Example constants (DOOR-CLOSED, DOOR-LOCKED, DOOR-OPEN);
;             feel free to be creative if you'd like to make a more
;             interesting door :)
;           - A signature, purpose statement, and tests (commented out)

; CODE HERE



; TODO 3/3: Uncomment the following function - you are not to change it,
;           but rather design the helper functions it references.
;           The first (change-closed-door) produces a DoorState based upon
;           the key pressed when the door is closed - this has been provided
;           for you. Your job is to implement the remaining two, which
;           determine the next state when the door is locked (change-locked-door)
;           and then open (change-open-door).
